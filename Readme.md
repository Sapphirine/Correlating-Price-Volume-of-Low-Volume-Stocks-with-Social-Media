The tools we build can be applied to different research topics for identifying leading indicators and building predictive models

1. We use "Data_Gathering_TwitterAPI.py" to collect data we feel interested.

2. We use "Data_Manipulation.R" to format, expand, and visualize data. 
   Then we select useful features to be used in our analysis.
   Perform small scale Naive Bayes Classification.

3. We use "Mahout_Naive_Bayes_Classification.sh" to perform large scale Naive Bayes Classification.
